As if the wait was not enough And one can only take so much You broke into pieces Seems hopeless now
But at least you know The tables can turn around And time will repay you And the rain comes and goes And all is forgiven,
Can we learn to let go So all is forgiven You're on your knees reaching out Reaching for someone To lift you up right off the ground,
Is anyone out there? You can't breathe, you're choking You'll make it through, just keep holding on I know that it won't be long
Til somebody saves you
